example:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
df = pd.DataFrame({'beer':[1,2,3],
                   'spirit':[4,5,6],
                   'wine':[7,8,9]}, index=['Africa','Asia','Europe'])

        beer  spirit  wine
Africa     1       4     7
Asia       2       5     8
Europe     3       6     9

df.T.plot.pie(subplots=True, figsize=(10, 3))

        -total deaths vs covid19 vs pnuem&covid19
        -total doses distributed vs Total doses administered by jurisdiction
        -total doses distributed vs Residents with at least one dose
